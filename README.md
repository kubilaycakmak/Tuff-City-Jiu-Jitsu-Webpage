application of web development concepts learned

This project is my final piece of coursework for the CodeCore Academy Web Development Bootcamp, due mid-June, 2021. I have recently enrolled as the co-instructor for the Shorinji Kan Jiu Jitsu club (affiliated with Jitsu Canada) in the small community of Tofino, BC. Unfortunately we have only been able to put on one training session in the last year, but we are looking forward to resuming classes with the increasing uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations. In anticipation of this ever-approaching goalpost, I could not think of a better way to apply my recently-gained webdev skills than to launch an official website for the club. The primary, longstanding motivation was to help serve as a bridge for instructors and other jitsuka transitioning between different countries which host Shorinji Kan clubs, but this and other goals are within the scope of the project. Perhaps not all of them will be achieved in the short timeframe allocated to complete the work, however there will be time for them after that academic milestone. They are summarised as follows:

• Provide a resource for "translating" between the UK and Canadian versions of the martial art's syllabus, which largely overlap, but with some significant differences, of which many are poorly understood by students and instructors alike. Aiming to achieve the universal standard of "if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth a million" with side-by-side multimedia comparisons

• A semantic tree map to visualise the different categories of syllabus techniques, as a memory-aid and to achieve deeper understanding

• A clear and compelling recruitment tool with the joint aims of empowering the local community, to provide solidarity and strength in numbers, and to foster a welcoming and fun social scene

• Incorporate a members section with content appropriately tailored according to the user's current belt grade and the next grade/qualifications they are working towards; eventually this might become more granular with 1:1 feedback and detailed technique-by-technique breakdowns

• Supplement and interface with existing social media websites for the club

• Robust enough interface that technology-averse members with seniority can nevertheless easily take on administrator roles

• An upcoming events page, for occasions ranging from the local to the global stages, hoping to ensure participation in person or by remote conferencing

• Use mapping APIs to provide information about other Jitsu Canada clubs and also some farther afield

• Ability to track attendance and to digitise the training waiver

• Official live deployment online e.g. with the Heroku platform
