<h1>Who Are We?</h1>

<img src={require('../img/club_pic(sans_seumas).jpg')} />

<p>We are the world's westernmost Shorinji Kan Jiu Jitsu club!
Our instructors hail from the United Kingdom but have come to
British Columbia to share their passion for jiu jitsu's ability
to empower self defence within the district of Tofino. They are
co-equals and both bring their individual experiences and
skillsets to the table as leaders. We already have a handful of
earnest beginners and can't wait to help drive them forward in
their journey towards better and better belts. We warmly welcome
more of the community to join the club and become confident not
just in violent situations but more broadly in life, too. The
COVID-19 pandemic has unfortunately limited what we can do in
training for the time being, but as we reopen we hope to reach
a point where masks will no longer be necessary and where we may
gather closely together to throw each other around and perform
some cool locks, ground fighting bouts or whatever takes our
fancy! Outside of the dojo, we are also looking forward to having
some fun recreational and social activities to help underline our
place as a vital component of the local community with the virus
becoming a distant memory.

<h1>Seumas Finlayson</h1>

<p>Seumas started training under Bruce Davies, Colin Armstrong
and Ian Lambert in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was drawn to the art
by it's dramatic depiction in films and video games, and was
interested in learning an effective martial art when he came to
study physics as an undergraduate. The city's clubs were very
welcoming with a mantra of "train hard, then play hard" and the
friendships he made there, nationally and across the globe ever
since will stay with him for life. He steadily climbed up the
grades despite a few setbacks and attained dark blue belt by the
time he had graduated. Next up was a stint training in Reading
during a Masters degree, and then in South West England for work,
serving as a sempai or senior mentor in these clubs. However he
was soon drawn back to his roots in Edinburgh and started
intensive training for brown belt, which he achieved in December,
2016. Since then he did some help teaching in the city but was
aching for a chance to take up more responsibilities, and such
opportunities were hard to find in such a talent-rich and
competitive environment. Always drawn to Canada, he connected
with David and resolved to come to work in Tofino and help run
the club. He managed this at the end of September 2020 despite
COVID's best efforts!

Even with only one training session in the books before another
wave of the virus had the district's sports shut down again, he
was happy to be part of the scene and eager to help develop the 
club into a flourishing dojo with several keen members. His short
term goals include grading the two resident novices to yellow
belt and David up to light blue belt. Long term he hopes to get a
good pool of new members who will become both proficient in self
defence and willing to oblige the senior members in dishing out
tough beatings to hone them up for subsequent gradings, and to
foster good links with the Kilarney, Vancouver club and those
further afield. A fond participant of the triennial Internationa
event, he has been present for it in Edinburgh, then in
Collingwood, Ontario, Canada, and most recently in Drakensberg,
South Africa. It's one of his earnest wishes that he'll be able
to attend the next event in Vienna, Austria, with the virus
hopefully more or less eradicated by then.</p>
